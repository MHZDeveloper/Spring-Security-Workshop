Hi everyone !!

This is an example that highlights the "Authentication&Authorization" tool provided by Spring Security.

In this example, you will notice that : 

-Non authenticated user can access only "/".

-Authenticated user can access "/" and "/user".

-Admin can access "/" and "/user" and "/admin".

Enjoy !!
